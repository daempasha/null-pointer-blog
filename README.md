_Null Pointer is a programming blog created using Sanity.io and Next.js_

## Aim
The aim of this project was to create a blog site that could easily be edited with a back-end CMS solution (Sanity.io), this will allow for addition, deletion and modifications to the production version without the need for re-deployment.

Another aim was to imitate a full design process from start to finish. I started by designing the application in Figma. Then I created the application in React and Sanity. After this, I created unit tests for the application. Finally, I used [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) to create a CI/CD workflow that will lint, test and then deploy my application to Netlify.
